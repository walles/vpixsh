# `vpixsh`

`vpixsh` is a shell featuring:

- Fully `bash` compatible command line syntax (unlike `fish`)
- No scripting support
- Web UI (idea from `fish`) for configuring:
  - Default environment variables (missing in `fish`)
  - `$PATH` value (missing in `fish`)
- `git` friendly prompt

Cred to
[https://random.org](https://random.org/strings/?num=10&len=4&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new)
for the name.

## TODO

- `bash` compatible command line parser
- Use `vpixsh` as my default shell
